# Iris-classification-ml-model
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to classify iris flower species using the classic Iris dataset. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and preprocessing to ensure high-quality inputs. Multiple classification algorithms were tested with hyperparameter tuning to identify the best performing model. Finally, a Logistic Regression Classifier was selected, achieving strong accuracy. The model was deployed through an interactive Streamlit web app, allowing users to input flower measurements and instantly receive predictions.
